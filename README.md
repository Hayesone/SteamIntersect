# SteamIntersect
No longer useful as Steam has updated their filtering options Steam library to include a Friends filter, finding common games between the users you select.

## About

To be used to find common games with your steam friends.

Uses SteamWebAPI to find people on a given SteamIDs friends list, the inputs that can be used are SteamID, Steam64ID, and vanity IDs (custom urls set by a user).

Using the Steam64ID, it grabs the friends of the given account and lists them out for the user to choose from. The chosen users from the friends list are people who you want to see common games between, including yourself.

Finally, after you have submitted the list of people, it will display all the games that are in common.
